## Pithy Quotes

>"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far."<br/>
>"If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better."<br/>
